# glossary

<b>abscissa</b><br>
Value that defines an horizontal position (from left to right) on-screen.

<b>argument</b><br>
Variable provided as input to a function.

<b>array</b><br>
Type of variable that can contain several values. The elements of an array are accessed by their index. The index of the first element is 0.

<b>blend mode</b><br>
When graphic elements are added to the screen, the blending mode determines how their pixels blend together. The default mode, BLEND, simply overlays elements,  the last element being drawn ontop of previously drawn elements.

<b>canvas</b><br>
This is the HTML element of our web page in which we draw.

<b>class</b><br>
Block of code that serves as a template for making objects. In particular, the class contains the constructor function, which defines the properties of objects to be made from this class, as well as functions that can be applied to them.

<b>client</b><br>
In a computer network, a client is a connected device (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) that requests information (raw data, web pages, files) from a server connected to the same network.

<b>comment</b><br>
Line of code that is not executed by the program but is visible to the developers. Comments are used to describe what the code does, to make it easier to maintain and share the code, and to facilitate teamwork.

<b>condition</b><br>
Block of code that introduces logic into the program. A question is asked, and depending on the answer, the program's behaviour is adapted. In order to do this we use the "if" and "else" keywords.

<b>constructor</b><br>
When building an object from a class, the constructor is the function called to implement its attributes.

<b>commparator</b><br>
Symbol used to compare two values or variables, to determine whether they are equal or different, or in the case of numbers, which is greater than the other. Comparators are most often used to define a condition.

<b>event</b><br>
Event triggered by a user action, such as clicking the mouse or typing on the keyboard.

<b>filter</b><br>
Effect applied to a texture, whether an image or a p5.Graphics.

<b>fps</b><br>
"Frames per seconds", the number of frames drawn per second, i.e. the frequency at which the draw() function is executed.

<b>function</b><br>
A block of code whose purpose is to perform a single task, and which can therefore be reused on demand. It can be seen as a tool. A function may (but not always) have arguments as input and return a variable as output.

<b>function "handler"</b><br>
When an event is triggered, the "handler" function is called, whose task is to process the event.

<b>GUI</b><br>
"Graphical User Interface". Graphical interface allowing the user to control certain parameters of the application.

<b>HTML</b><br>
Programming language used to structure the content of a web page. It is in the HTML file where, for instance, we import p5.js and other libraries we wish to use, the "canvas" element is created, and we link the sketch.js JavaScript file in which our program is executed.

<b>JavaScript</b><br>
A very popular programming language, mainly used to make web pages dynamic and interactive.

<b>level</b><br>
Sound level, i.e. the volume, expressed in decibels.

<b>library</b><br>
Set of code (variables and functions) written and made available to developers to extend the possibilities of a language. p5.js is a JavaScript library made available to facilitate graphic and interactive creation.

<b>loop</b><br>
A loop is used to repeat an operation, count or iterate through an array. The keyword is "for". A loop consists of three parts: initialisation of the iterator, the stopping condition and the update of the iterator.

<b>object</b><br>
Block of code used to group together several properties in a single variable.

<b>mask</b><br>
Texture (image or p5.Graphics) which, when applied to an image, masks off certain parts of it. The hidden parts are the transparent areas of the mask.

<b>ordinate</b><br>
Value that determines a vertical position (top to bottom) on the screen.

<b>p5.Graphics</b><br>
"Buffer" texture used to draw off-screen.

<b>pixel</b><br>
The basic unit of image definition. Each pixel contains 4 pieces of information, the red, green, blue and alpha (transparency) values.

<b>server</b><br>
In a computer network, a server is a computer that provides information (raw data, web pages, files) at the request of a client connected to the same network.

<b>sketch</b><br>
JavaScript file in which our p5.js program runs.

<b>variable</b><br>
A memory slot to which a name and value are assigned so that they can be reused at a later date. A variable can be a number, a string, an image, an array, an object, etc.
