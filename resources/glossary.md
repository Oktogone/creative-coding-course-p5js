**glossary**

abscissa
Value that defines an horizontal position (from left to right) on-screen.

API
Third-party service that makes data available for application development. To access the service, an HTTP request is made.

argument
Variable provided as input to a function.

array
Type of variable that can contain several values. The elements of an array are accessed by their index. The index of the first element is 0.

blend mode
When graphic elements are added to the screen, the blending mode determines how their pixels blend together. The default mode, BLEND, simply overlays elements,  the last element being drawn ontop of previously drawn elements.

canvas
This is the HTML element of our web page in which we draw.

class
Block of code that serves as a template for making objects. In particular, the class contains the constructor function, which defines the properties of objects to be made from this class, as well as functions that can be applied to them.

client
In a computer network, a client is a connected device (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) that requests information (raw data, web pages, files) from a server connected to the same network.

condition
Block of code that introduces logic into the program. A question is asked, and depending on the answer, the program's behaviour is adapted. In order to do this we use the "if" and "else" keywords.

constructor
When building an object from a class, the constructor is the function called to implement its attributes.

event
Event triggered by a user action, such as clicking the mouse or typing on the keyboard.

filter
Effect applied to a texture, whether an image or a p5.Graphics.

fps
"Frames per seconds", the number of frames drawn per second, i.e. the frequency at which the draw() function is executed.

function
A block of code whose purpose is to perform a single task, and which can therefore be reused on demand. It can be seen as a tool. A function may (but not always) have arguments as input and return a variable as output.

function "callback"
When a request is made to an API, it is asynchronous, i.e. the program does not wait for the response and continues to run. Once the response is received, the "callback" function is called, whose task is to process the data supplied.

function "handler"
When an event is triggered, the "handler" function is called, whose task is to process the event.

GUI
"Graphical User Interface". Graphical interface allowing the user to control certain parameters of the application.

HTML
Programming language used to structure the content of a web page. It is in the HTML file where, for instance, we import p5.js and other libraries we wish to use, the "canvas" element is created, and we link the sketch.js JavaScript file in which our program is executed.

JavaScript
A very popular programming language, mainly used to make web pages dynamic and interactive.

level
Sound level, i.e. the volume, expressed in decibels.

library
Set of code (variables and functions) written and made available to developers to extend the possibilities of a language. p5.js is a JavaScript library made available to facilitate graphic and interactive creation.

loop
A loop is used to repeat an operation, count or iterate through an array. The keyword is "for". A loop consists of three parts: initialisation of the iterator, the stopping condition and the update of the iterator.

object
Block of code used to group together several properties in a single variable.

mask
Texture (image or p5.Graphics) which, when applied to an image, masks off certain parts of it. The hidden parts are the transparent areas of the mask.

ordinate
Value that determines a vertical position (top to bottom) on the screen.

p5.Graphics
"Buffer" texture used to draw off-screen.

pixel
The basic unit of image definition. Each pixel contains 4 pieces of information, the red, green, blue and alpha (transparency) values.

server
In a computer network, a server is a computer that provides information (raw data, web pages, files) at the request of a client connected to the same network.

sketch
JavaScript file in which our p5.js program runs.

variable
A memory slot to which a name and value are assigned so that they can be reused at a later date. A variable can be a number, a string, an image, an array, an object, etc.
